        <p>Hi, I'm Em. I'm the Type A Friend. This is a goofy site I built in order to make planning with friends easier. The hardest part is always finding a time that works for everyone, so I figured I can just make my own tool and share it with you too!</p>
        <p>This site is completely free to use, but if you enjoyed it, consider checking out my Ko-Fi! Give bro a chance to survive in this economy.</p>
